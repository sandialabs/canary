"""Module for finding the user's preferred text editor.

Defines one function, editor(), which invokes the editor defined by the
user's VISUAL environment variable if set. We fall back to the editor
defined by the EDITOR environment variable if VISUAL is not set or the
specified editor fails (e.g. no DISPLAY for a graphical editor). If
neither variable is set, we fall back to one of several common editors,
raising an EnvironmentError if we are unable to find one.

This file was adapted from spack.util.editor
